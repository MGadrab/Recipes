    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>
    A smashed burger is a type of burger made by pressing a ball of ground beef flat onto a hot griddle or skillet, creating a crispy, caramelized crust while keeping the inside juicy.
    It's usually thin, flavorful, and served with classic toppings like cheese, pickles, onions, and sauce on a soft bun.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 IB Ground Beef (80/20 Lean)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>American Cheese</li>
        <li>Burger buns (Brioche Buns are the best!)</li>
        <li>1/2 Onion sliced or diced</li>
        <li>1/2 stick of Butter</li>
        <h4>Optional Toppings</h4>
        <li>pickles</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the meat with the salt and pepper; then divide them into 3 oz balls and put them back into the fridge.</li>
        <li>Crank the skillet to high. Grab your buns and spread a good amount of butter on those nice buns.</li>
        <li>While the skillet is heating, place the buttered side of the buns on the skillet and take them off once golden brown. </li>
        <li>Now set those buns aside and bring out that meat, place the meat onto the skillet and <strong>JUST SMASH EM</strong> with all your might. they should be reallll thin.</li>
        <li>After smashing the meats, place the sliced or diced onions ontop of them. After 2 minutes you will flip them.</li>
        <li>Now that you flipped them add a slice of American cheese to each patty. Wait two minutes again</li>
        <li>Lastly put a patty into a bun, or two if you real hungry. then garnish it however you please such as pickles, tomatoes and lettuce. </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>BONUS SAUCE</h3>
    <p>to liven up the burger I reccomend making this sauce. all you need is:
        <ul><li>Mayonnaise: 2 tbsp</li>
        <li>Ketchup: 1 tbsp</li>
        <li>Mustard: 1 tsp</li>
        <li>Pickle relish: 1 tsp</li>
        <li>Garlic powder: 1/4 tsp</li>
        <li>Onion powder: 1/4 tsp</li>
        <li>Vinegar or lemon juice: A few drops</li>
        </ul>
       Just mix all these Ingredients together and you will have the sauce ready to put in the burger.
